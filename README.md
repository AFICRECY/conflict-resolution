# conflict-resolution

This specific type of conflict is not as common as others you will face throughout your career as a developer. These types of conflicts typically arise when we collaborate with others and the projects become more complex, so this is a good opportunity to learn how conflicts may come about and how we can address them without the increased pressure of a larger application.mpfviknefpvinfvn
